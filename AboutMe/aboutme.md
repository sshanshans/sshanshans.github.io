## About me
![me](/images/sshan.jpg)

I am Shan Shan. My name in Chinese characters is 单珊. I am an assistant professor at the Centre of Quantum Mathematics and the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of Syddansk Universitet. I work on quantum computation, shape analysis, and the mathematical framework for machine learning. 

Previously, I was at Duke University. In 2019, I received my PhD in mathematics, with a thesis advised by [Ingrid Daubechies](/images/SSID.png) on probabilistic models on fiber bundles. In 2019-2020, I was a postdoc researcher at Duke. I did my bachelor's studies at Agnes Scott College, a women's college in Atlanta, where I graduated *summa cum laude* in 2014.  I also spent a year (2013) in Hungary for the Budapest Semester in Mathematics.

Besides doing math, I like to read and practice calligraphy. I used to do weight-lifting, but nowadays I enjoy swimming more. I am a big fan of [Haruki Murakami](http://www.harukimurakami.com). I am also a bad pianist and a newbie violin player. 

I grew up in Qingdao (青岛), a coastal city in China.
