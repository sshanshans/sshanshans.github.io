I grew up in Tsingtao, a coastal city in China. My name in Chinese characters is å•çŠ. I went to Agnes Scott College, where I became a mathematician, art lover, and feminist. I have lived in three continents so far. <br />

Besides doing math,

* I like to powerlift, and w.h.p you will find me lifting weights in Wilson. <br />
     + deadlift: 225lbs <br />
     + squat: 165lbs <br /> 
     + bench press: oops,Iâ€™m not so good at thisâ€¦ <br />
<br />
* I like to read, and here are some authors I read often. <br />
     + [Haruki Murakami](http://www.harukimurakami.com): I recommend all of them. Indeed, nobody knows me better than him. <br />
     + Dostoyevski: Brothers K is my favorite.  <br />
<br />
* I like other things as well. <br />
     calligraphy, art museums, farmersâ€™ market,â€¦

Here is a picture of me just being my self.
